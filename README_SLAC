SLAC-specific Changes to ADAravis
---------------------------------

Makefile Changes
----------------

Makefiles were changed to use libraries from $(PACKAGE_SITE_TOP) or
$(PSPKG_ROOT), depending on the deployment environment.

To disable this behavior and link to system libraries, use

  USE_SYSTEM_LIBS=YES

In your configure/CONFIG_SITE. Setting this to YES matches the
behavior of ADAravis as it was designed upstream.

Alternatively, you can set USE_SYSTEM_LIBS on the command line:

  make USE_SYSTEM_LIBS=YES
